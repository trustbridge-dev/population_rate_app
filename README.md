Overview
This Flask application is designed to collect, analyze, and present population data from an external API. It incorporates various features, including data persistence, RESTful API endpoints, unit and integration testing, event-driven messaging, and production monitoring. The application demonstrates a robust architecture that seamlessly scales and integrates with other services.

Use Cases
  •	Population Analysis: Users can analyze population trends over time, gaining insights into demographic changes.
  •	Event-Driven Processing: The application can trigger external processes or notifications based on population data updates.
  •	Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle increased loads and integrate with other services as needed.

Key Components and refinements 
1.	Production Environment
    a.	Deployment: Deployed on Heroku, leveraging its platform for easy scaling and management.
    b.	Gunicorn: Uses Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server for handling concurrent requests in production.
    c.	Environment Variables: Configuration is managed using environment variables to handle different settings for development and production.
2.	Data Collection
    a.	Source: The application fetches population data from the DataUSA API using the ‘requests’ library.
    b.	Filtering: Data is filtered to include only the years 2013 to 2020, ensuring the app processes relevant information.
    c.	Storage: Fetched data is stored in an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, facilitating easy data access and manipulation.
3.	Data Persistence with SQLAlchemy
    a.	ORM: SQLAlchemy is used as the Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to define data models and interact with the SQLite database.
    b.	Schema: The ‘PopulationData’ table stores information on the population for each month and year.
    c.	CRUD Operations: The application supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database.
4.	Data Analyzer
    a.	Functionality: The application calculates yearly population totals, allowing users to analyze trends over time.
    b.	Endpoints: Users can retrieve analyzed data through the ‘/get_analysis’ endpoint, which returns aggregated data in JSON format.
5.	REST API Endpoints
    a.	Update Population Data: ‘/update_population_data’ endpoint fetches and updates population data in the database.
    b.	Yearly Analysis: ‘/get_analysis’ endpoint provides users with yearly population summaries.
    c.	Metrics: ‘/metrics’ endpoint exposes application metrics, such as total entries and unique years.
6.	Unit Tests
    a.	Testing Framework: Utilizes Python's built-in ‘unittest’ framework to test core functionalities.
    b.	Mock Objects: Uses ‘unittest.mock’ to simulate data fetching from external APIs, ensuring tests are independent and reliable.
    c.	Core Logic Testing: Focuses on testing functions like ‘get_yearly_averages’ to ensure accurate computations.
7.	Integration Tests
    a.	End-to-End Testing: Tests the integration of various components, including API endpoints and database interactions.
    b.	Data Flow Verification: Ensures data flows correctly through the system, from fetching to analysis and persistence.
    c.	Mocked Dependencies: Uses mocked data to simulate real-world scenarios and verify system behavior.
8.	Health Checkpoint
    a.	Metrics Endpoint: The ‘/metrics’ endpoint serves as a health checkpoint, providing insights into application performance and data integrity.
    b.	Monitoring: Tracks application health and resource usage, aiding in early detection of issues.
9.	Production Monitoring and Instrumentation
    a.	Logging: Application logs provide detailed information about operations, errors, and warnings.
    b.	Monitoring Tools: Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Heroku Metrics, New Relic) can provide real-time insights into application performance.
10.	Event Collaboration Messaging
    a.	RabbitMQ Integration: Utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging, decoupling components and enabling event-driven architecture.
    b.	Pika Library: Implements publishers and consumers using Pika, allowing for real-time event collaboration.
    c.	Use Case: On updating population data, a message is sent to a RabbitMQ queue, where it can be processed by separate consumers for further actions or notifications.
